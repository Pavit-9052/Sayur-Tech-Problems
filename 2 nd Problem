'''2. You are writing an essay. You don't want the any word to appear very frequently. Write a program that will take your essay as input (maybe from a file) and print the number of times each unique word appears in your essay.'''

para="Repetition is when a single word or phrase is used multiple times in short succession for effect. It can help emphasise a point. For example, I have to practice my times tables over so I can learn them vs I have to practice my times tables over and over and over again so I can learn them."
a=para.lower().split()

for word in a:
    if word in dict:
        dict[word] += 1
    else:
        dict[word] = 1

    print(f"{key}:{value}")
